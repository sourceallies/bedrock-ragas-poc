In many of the cases I tried, it meant the LLM gave back responses that were not in JSON format, and the follow up prompts RAGAS used to try and get it to format them correctly were unsuccessful.  When this happened, that record in the dataset ends up with `Nan` instead of a score.\n",

Also, sometimes it responds to the example info instead of the last passed in example that we are targeting.  This leads to incorrect scores.  This is hard to see in the full dataset, but easier to see in the custom dataset, which should have 1 exact match for an answer, and one incorrect answer, resulting in around a .5 score.\n",
